# MySite
The purpose of this site is to organize projects I have made, or have worked on with others. It condenses my skills as a software engineer, and audio engineer into a convient location that is easy to look at. It also contains information on how to contact me.

The site is developed using bootstrap and angular, and is responsive to changes in its size.
